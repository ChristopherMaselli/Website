description: "In the time I worked at Sony Music I spent my off-time preparing the digital infrastructure I would need in order to host the game I planned to build in the future. Knowing the game would take a while to fully develop, I realized learning everything I needed to build the proper web-functionality would be a far better use of my time. Something applicable to other aspects of my career and something I am very proud to have taken the time to build. 

The Website uses a secure JWT (Json Web Token) Authentication system to safely manage the login and registration system in a professional manner. The site, built with React and C# connects to a postgres database from which all of the user and game information is stored and retrieved. The site accepts transactional payments using the Stripe payment processing API interface, allowing it to manage purchases and subscriptions. Finally the Website is hosted using Docker containers, which help to manage each instance of a person logging on to play the game. The site successfully hosted a prototype of the game being developed and even allowed for interacting directly with the unity game with code entered into the website (Thus allowing for the game itself to read who was logged in at the time)."
