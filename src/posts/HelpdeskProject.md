description: "Deciding to expand my skillset in my off time, I began building the helpdesk project. Equipped with a functioning front-end and API/Backend, the helpdesk project allows users to create or edit tasks and organize them into columns categorized by completion. Users create or edit tasks in the front end through a form, then submit the information. Once submitted, the information travels through an ASP.NET ES6 API backend using the Post or Put command and entered into a PostgreSQL database, where the information is stored/changed. The application retrieves tasks through custom SQL Query “Get” commands, which obtain the tasks by completion status, and sends them down to the front-end where the information is displayed. Developing this project equipped me with the fundamentals of full-stack web development, skills that proved invaluable to my next project."
