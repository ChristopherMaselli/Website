description: "Sony Music Entertainment became the next step of my Software Development career path. Here I primarily managed the database functionality for the Global Paperless Requisition System (GPRS). I built the requisition verification processes and helped manage various other functionality in both the database and front-end aspects of the system (spending a few weeks to self-teach myself Angular in the process). Various other responsibilities included: Managing code updates using the Github version control system and properly transcribing older code from the Oracle system to the newer version on Postgres."
