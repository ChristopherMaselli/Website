description: "During my off time in the Bioengineering days. I learned to code with the mentorship of my brother. During that time we built the game-project together. Written in Unity/C#, the game combines aspects of boardgame-style play (similar to chess), with multi-functional pieces mixed with a card game. Cards are drawn and used to summon units to the board, and each unit summoned contained unique functioning abilities. Using UDP in a .NET framework allowed the game local playability. Functionally the game works as intended, with 4 decks to choose from."
