description: "Realizing the need for a place to display my projects, I constructed the website project. Built with a Gatsby-React framework, the front-end allowed for modularization of page architecture. Using the same template with different informational input resulted in less page-bloat in the code, and far less work on the designerâ€™s part. A combination of react-plugins mixed with HTML and CSS resulted in the design of the website, along with the animative functionality displayed. Currently still a work in progress, as more features (including a direct message function) are planned for the future."
