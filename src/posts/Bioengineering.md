description: "Progenitor Cell Therapy responsibilities included: sampling, volume reduction, centrifugation, and separation of blood stem cells from plasma, HVAC record-keeping, documentation accuracy, and releasing products. I managed cryopreservation of stem cells using a cryopreservative addition and controlled-rate freezing. Later work included working with CD3 cells, cells capable of inducing cancer remission in patients."
