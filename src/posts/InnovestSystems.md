description: "Innovest Systems LLC became my first Software Development opportunity. While working for Innovest my responsibilities largely consisted of managing SQL functions. Having coded the SQL applications of the game project, I considered SQL-Backend functionality my strongest skill. Along with SQL maintenance, my responsibilities included HTML and JavaScript development, along with Version Control System maintenance. My time as an Innovest employee resulted in SQL becoming my strongest language, familiarizing me with complicated database architecture."
